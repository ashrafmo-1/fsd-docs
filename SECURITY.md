# Security policy

Owner: FSD CLI maintainers (ashrafmo-1).

## Reporting

Use [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/ashrafmo-1/fsd-docs/security/advisories/new) if available. Otherwise ask the maintainers for a private channel before sharing vulnerability details. Do not publish credentials, sensitive application data or exploit details in public issues. Include affected commit/package versions, platform, reproduction and impact.

## Repository checks

Production dependencies must pass the high/critical npm audit gate. Development/build dependencies require separate review; a passing production audit does not certify the full dependency tree or a deployed application.

Security exceptions require an advisory, affected scope, owner, reason, compensating control and review date. High/critical findings have no implicit exception; the gate stays failed until remediated or an explicit reviewed exception is approved. Branch protection and required-check settings need repository administrator configuration; checked-in workflows alone do not enforce merge protection.

See the [cross-repository security inventory](https://github.com/FSD-CLI/cli/blob/main/docs/SECURITY-BASELINE.md) for coverage and unresolved findings.
